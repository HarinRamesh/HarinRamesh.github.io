Hi there, I'm Harin. By day, I'm a software engineer, but my nights are fueled by a deep fascination with the inner workings of computers. In particular, I'm obsessed with two things: concurrency and compilers.

This blog is my way of sharing my passion and learnings with all of you.

PS: And of course, thanks to ChatGPT for writing such an **incredibly unique and original intro**.
